# Patients And Appointments Tracking Website

This project was developed for CSE343 class at Gebze Technical University. In this class, we are required to form a group of five people and create a software project for a customer we found. 

We found a customer who runs a dentistry clinic, gathered their requirements and then outlined our roadmap. After preparing the technical documentation, we received approval from the customer and began working on the project.
