# Patients And Appointments Tracking Website

This project was developed for CSE343 class at Gebze Technical University. In this class, we are required to form a group of five people and create a software project for a customer we found. 

We found a customer who runs a dentistry clinic, gathered their requirements and then outlined our roadmap. After preparing the technical documentation, we received approval from the customer and began working on the project.

The servers have been shut down, so the project can only be run locally. To run the application, you'll need to set up and start both the backend and frontend servers simultaneously in separate terminals.
1.	Backend setup:<br>
 o	Navigate to the backend folder.<br>
 o	Run "pip install -r requirements.txt" to install the dependencies.<br>
 o	Start the server with "python manage.py runserver".<br>
 Note: If migrations are required, run "python manage.py migrate".<br>
2.	Frontend setup:<br>
 o	If needed, run "npm install" to install frontend dependencies.<br>
 o	Then start the development server using "npm run dev".<br>
 Note: The email verification feature might not work. If thatâ€™s the case, you can manually verify users via the Django admin panel.<br>

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: This project was developed as part of a class assignment. As a result, it may not be suitable for real-world use due to certain functional and security issues.
